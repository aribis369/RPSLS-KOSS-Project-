# rps.py readme:-
Upon run,the game takes into input the name of the player playing with the computer. Then the code opens up a window which has the five members of the game in form of buttons and the player has to press any one of them. When the compiler gets input from the pressed button it decides the winner and displays its name along with the moves played by each side.
Developments that can be done in this code:-
1.) A better GUI can be presented.
2.) GIFs can be used to make it more fun.
3.) More buttons including Scorecard,History.
4.) The game can be made for two players.
5.) New members can be added.
6.) The game can be made a bit a difficult by using the previous data of the game(making the computer a bit experienced). Eg- Suppose the responses of any user are R,P,P,S,L,R,R then the computer can guess the next probable move of the player by using the data from previous users playing the same responses. If the probability is high then the computer is likely to respond a counter move.
